Unity3D library for AppWarp.You simply need to download [AppWarpUnity.dll](https://github.com/shephertz/AppWarpUnity/blob/master/v1.1/AppWarpUnity.dll?raw=true) and import it as an Asset in to your Unity project 
and you are all set!

Visit our [Unity Developer home page](https://github.com/shephertz/AppWarpDeveloper/wiki/Unity-Home) to learn more about AppWarp and using our AppWarp SDK.

Note* If you are running the application as an Editor Application, you should listen to playmodeStateChanged events
and call the Disconnect API of WarpClient instance. This will prevent your editor from hanging when the app quits.
